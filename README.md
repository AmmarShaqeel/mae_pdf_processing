maybank bank statement PDF processing for Credit and Debit. Been looking for a way to convert my maybank bank statement into excel so I can track better. Unfortunately there are not many options out there to do it. 

It is **completely free** -- I've created a python program and converted into a graphical user interface. 

Because this program read and create files on your local computer. I've included the source code to show that there a **no** malicious intent. You can also simply copy the code and paste it in ChatGPT and ask whether there are any parts of the code that has malicious intent

1. ***Select Folder with PDFs***: After placing all of your Bank Statements into a single folder. Click **Browse** and navigate onto the folder where you stored all your bank statements
2. ***Select Export Path***: This is where you want to save the excel file on your computer. You can specify where you want to save it on your local computer. Or you could also save it in the same folder with the PDFs.
3. ***Enter Excel Filename (without extentsion)***:  There's no need to specify whetehr its ".xlsx" or ".csv", it will automatically save the file as CSV.
4.  ***Select Processing Mode***: The PDF structure of **Debit** and **Credit** statement are different, this is why there is a drop down option for you to select whether you wan to process Debit or Credit.
   **REMINDER: DEBIT AND CREDIT BANK STATEMENTS MUST BE IN A DIFFERENT FOLDER**


## Finally, process the file by clicking on "Process Files and Export to Excel" 

1. It will process all of your pdfs that you put into the folder and convert them into Excel format for you to perform further analysis and detailed tracking of your income and expenses.
